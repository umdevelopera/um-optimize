#### CSS and JS

Ultimate Member loads various styles and scripts that are necessary for its components to work.
Extensions can also load their own styles and scripts. Loading many styles and scripts can slow down page rendering.
It is recommended to disable loading of Ultimate Member styles and scripts on pages that do not have its components.

Loading one large style or script file has less impact on page rendering delay than loading multiple files.
It is recommended to combine multiple Ultimate Member styles and scripts into one style file and one script file.

- **Dequeue unused styles** - Dequeue CSS files on pages that do not have Ultimate Member components.
- **Dequeue unused scripts** - Dequeue JS files on pages that do not have Ultimate Member components.
- **Combine styles** - Combine CSS files queued by the Ultimate Member plugin and its extensions.
- **Combine scripts** - Combine JS files queued by the Ultimate Member plugin and its extensions.

#### Images

Ultimate Member does not allow using Cover Photo and Profile Photo images from the browser cache.
This approach is safe and secure, but it slows down rendering the member directory and pages with Ultimate Member components.
It is recommended to allow using images from the browser cache.

Ultimate Member uses the largest Cover Photo thumbnail in the member directory on the desktop.
However, the directory does not need large images.
It is recommended to use Cover Photo thumbnail that is about 500 pixels wide to load images faster.

- **Profile Photo caching** - Allow using Profile Photo images from the browser cache.
- **Cover Photo caching** - Allow using Cover Photo images from the browser cache.
- **Cover Photo size in directory** - Select the size of the Cover Photo thumbnail for the member directory.

#### SQL queries

Ultimate Member uses the standard WP_Query and WP_User_Query classes to build database queries.
Queries created this way are reliable and stable, but are not optimized for speed.
This slows down retrieving users in the member directory and posts in extensions that use custom post type.
It is recommended to enable SQL queries optimization to get posts and members faster.

- **Speed up member directories** - *(optional)* Optimize the SQL query that retrieves users for the member directory.
- **Speed up Activity** - *(optional)* Optimize the SQL query that retrieves posts for the [Social Activity](https://ultimatemember.com/extensions/social-activity/) extension.
- **Speed up Groups** - *(optional)* Optimize the SQL query that retrieves posts for the [Groups](https://ultimatemember.com/extensions/groups/) extension.
- **Speed up Notes** - *(optional)* Optimize the SQL query that retrieves notes for the [User Notes](https://ultimatemember.com/extensions/user-notes/) extension.
- **Speed up Photos** - *(optional)* Optimize the SQL query that retrieves albums for the [User Photos](https://ultimatemember.com/extensions/user-photos/) extension.
- **Speed up Reviews** - *(optional)* Optimize the SQL query that retrieves reviews for the [User Reviews](https://ultimatemember.com/extensions/user-reviews/) extension.
