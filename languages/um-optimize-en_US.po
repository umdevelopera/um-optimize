"Ultimate Member does not allow using Cover Photo and Profile Photo images "
"from the browser cache. This approach is safe and secure, but it slows down "
"rendering pages with Ultimate Member components and loading the member "
"directory. It is recommended to allow using images from the browser cache if "
"your site is public. Ultimate Member uses the largest Cover Photo thumbnail "
"in the member directory on the desktop. Such large images are usually not "
"necessary. It is recommended to use an image that is 500px wide or slightly "
"larger."

"Ultimate Member loads various styles and scripts that are necessary for its "
"components to work. Extensions can also load their own styles and scripts. "
"Loading many styles and scripts can slow down page rendering. It is "
"recommended to disable loading of Ultimate Member styles and scripts on "
"pages that do not have its components. Loading one large style or script "
"file has less impact on page rendering delay than loading multiple files. It "
"is recommended to combine multiple Ultimate Member styles and scripts into "
"one style file and one script file."

"Ultimate Member uses the standard WP_Query and WP_User_Query classes to "
"build database queries. Queries built this way are reliable and stable, but "
"not optimized. This slows down retrieving users in the user directory and "
"posts in extensions that use custom post type, which slows down page "
"rendering. It is recommended to enable SQL queries optimization to get posts "
"and users faster."
