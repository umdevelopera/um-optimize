"Ultimate Member does not allow using Cover Photo and Profile Photo images "
"from the browser cache. This approach is safe and secure, but it slows down "
"rendering pages with Ultimate Member components and loading the member "
"directory. It is recommended to allow using images from the browser cache if "
"your site is public. Ultimate Member uses the largest Cover Photo thumbnail "
"in the member directory on the desktop. Such large images are usually not "
"necessary. It is recommended to use an image that is 500px wide or slightly "

"pages that do not have its components. Loading one large style or script "
